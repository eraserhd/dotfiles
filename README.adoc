eraserhd's dotfiles
===================

Manual Installation Steps (Still)
---------------------------------

- Add Apple ID in System Settings (I think this made 1Password easier).
- `mkdir src && cd src`
- `git clone https://github.com/eraserhd/dotfiles`
- Install Homebrew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew install 1password`
- Install Nix multi-user: `sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)`
- `nix-shell -p gnupg git-crypt`
- `gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import secret.key # secret.key downloaded from 1Password`
- `git crypt unlock`
- `cp ./networking/ssh/files/id_rsa /tmp/id_rsa && chmod 06040 /tmp/id_rsa && ssh-add /tmp/id_rsa`
- was building for the wrong system, changed hostname for macbook and changed system to aarch64-darwin, but
  the twou package no longer worked because the flake doesn't have support for it, so commented it out.
- `nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" run nix-darwin -- switch --flake .`
- `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:eraserhd/dotfiles.git`
- `op`, needed to "Enable integration with 3rd Party Apps"

2021 Crunch
-----------

* Install NixOS with WPA config
* nix-shell -p kakoune git gnupg
* git clone dotfiles 
* Set programs.gnupg.agent.enable = true; nixos-rebuild switch (pinentry problem)
* reboot, because the above doesn't appear to fix it
* Set programs.gnupg.agent.pinentryFlavor and enableExtraSocket (not sure which)
* Lots of systemctl --user restart gpg-agent
* git crypt unlock -- works!!
