eraserhd's dotfiles
===================

Manual Installation Steps (Still)
---------------------------------

- Install developer tools (clone https:// URL prompted me)
- `git clone https://github.com/eraserhd/dotfiles`
- manually install homebrew by running the line in script/boostrap
- Install Nix multi-user: `sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)`
- nix-env -i gnupg git-crypt

- Manually brew install 1Password
- Scan code from phone code - entered code in app, actually
- gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import private-key.txt # downloaded from 1Password
- gpg --import public-key.txt # downloaded from 1Password

- git crypt unlock (working directory needed to be clean, needed to git reset --hard from failed git submodule update)

- `ssh-add ./networking/ssh/files/id_rsa`

- was building for the wrongs system, changed hostname for macbook and changed system to aarch64-darwin, but
  the twou package no longer worked because the flake doesn't have support for it, so commented it out.

- `nix build --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" ./#darwinConfigurations#C02CW0J5ML87.system`
- ./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch

- chsh -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh

- Switch remote to git@github.com:eraserhd/dotfiles.git ('cause we now have SSH).
- nix-env -e gnupg
- nix-env -e git-crypt

- Found no ~/src/data, reran git/install.sh by itself. "authenticity of host 'eraserhead.net (nn.nn." from SSH!) Why?
- 1p, needed to "Enable integration with 3rd Party Apps"

2021 Crunch
-----------

* Install NixOS with WPA config
* nix-env -i kakoune git gnupg
* git clone dotfiles 
* Set programs.gnupg.agent.enable = true; nixos-rebuild switch (pinentry problem)
* reboot, because the above doesn't appear to fix it
* Set programs.gnupg.agent.pinentryFlavor and enableExtraSocket (not sure which)
* Lots of systemctl --user restart gpg-agent
* git crypt unlock -- works!!
