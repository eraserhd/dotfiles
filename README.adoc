eraserhd's dotfiles
===================

The organization and a lot of scripts were stolen from https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.

Manual Installation Steps (Still)
---------------------------------

- Install developer tools (clone https:// URL prompted me)
- Run git clone again
- manually install homebrew by running the line in script/boostrap
- Manually brew install 1Password
- Scan code from phone code
- brew install gnupg
- gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import private-key.txt # downloaded from 1Password
- gpg --import public-key.txt # downloaded from 1Password
- brew install git-crypt

- Had to restart Google Chrome (already installed by IT) for 1Password to work
- Needed to use SMS for 2FA for 2u Google
- git crypt unlock (working directory needed to be clean, needed to git reset --hard from failed git submodule update)

- Install Nix multi-user: `sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon`
- Install nix-darwin: `nix-build -I darwin-config=macbook.nix -I nixpkgs

- Run ssh/install.sh works!

- Alacritty did not work, because cargo was not installed (rustup doesn't install stable)
- Run `rustup-init`, select 1) default install.
- Needed to source ~/.bash_profile to get cargo in the path
- rustup-init added a line to ~/.bash_profile which was already there, git reset --hard
- Destination `alacritty` already exists and is not an empty directory
- alacritty build script needed to be fixed for when alacritty was already checked out in ~/src
- Switch remote to git@github.com:eraserhd/dotfiles.git ('cause we now have SSH).
- Found no ~/src/data, reran git/install.sh by itself. "authenticity of host 'eraserhead.net (nn.nn." from SSH!) Why?
- java wasn't installed, but cask thoght it was.  brew cask reinstall java worked.
- 1p, needed to "Enable integration with 3rd Party Apps", then in Alfred,
  click around to get that stuff back.
